# Agent Notes

## Release workflow (vX.Y.Z)

- Update versions in `package.json`, `cashu-for-woocommerce.php` (header + `CASHU_WC_VERSION`), `tests/bootstrap.php`, and stable tag/changelog in `readme.txt`.
- Run `./build.sh` to generate distributable assets and translation files.
- Commit the changes and push to `main`.
- Create an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` and push tags.
- Publish a GitHub release for the tag (non‑prerelease) to trigger `.github/workflows/release-zip.yml`, which builds and uploads `cashu-for-woocommerce.zip`.

## Project specifics

- The release workflow validates tag version matches `package.json` and the plugin header version in `cashu-for-woocommerce.php`.
- `README.md` is generated by the Grunt startfile during `./build.sh`; don’t edit it by hand.
- Translations are generated via `grunt`/`wp i18n` during build; expect `languages/cashu-for-woocommerce.pot` to update.
